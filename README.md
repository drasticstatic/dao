   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start local blockchain**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat node
   ```

4. **Deploy contracts** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

5. **Seed initial data**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/seed.js --network localhost
   ```

6. **Run test scenarios** (optional)
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/test-abstain.js --network localhost
   npx hardhat run scripts/test-oppose.js --network localhost
   npx hardhat run scripts/test-ready-finalize.js --network localhost
   npx hardhat run scripts/test-ready-cancel.js --network localhost
   ```

7. **Start frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

8. **Configure MetaMask**
   - Add localhost network (RPC: http://localhost:8545, Chain ID: 31337)
   - Import test accounts using private keys from Hardhat node output

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Basic Operations
1. **Create Proposals**: Fill out the form with proposal details and funding amount
2. **Vote on Proposals**: Use "👍 For", "👎 Against" buttons, or abstain
3. **Finalize Proposals**: Click "Finalize" when positive votes reach quorum (🤩 Ready to Finalize)
4. **Cancel Proposals**: Click "Cancel" when negative votes reach quorum (😞 Ready to Cancel)
5. **View Analytics**: Monitor DAO activity through the comprehensive analytics dashboard

### Understanding the Interface
- **Status Badges**: Show current proposal state (In Progress 😁, Ready to Finalize 🤩, etc.)
