     * This is a common issue in Solidity when functions have too many parameters.
     *
     * PROBLEM: Single function with many parameters causes stack overflow
     * SOLUTION: Split into two functions with different parameter sets
     *
     * ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS:
     * 1. Use structs as parameters (but can still cause issues)
     * 2. Split complex functions into smaller internal functions
     * 3. Use storage references instead of memory variables
     * 4. Reduce local variable count in functions
     *
     * The following shows different approaches to the same functionality.
